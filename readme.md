# Prediction of Cryptocurrencies 
The project aimed at predicting the behavior of a cryptocurrency with the given a dataset of values and time stamps. The approach that was chosen consists of finding stationarities in its behavior to predict 12 more values. In order to do so, the python libraries statsmodels and pandas were used. 

## How to test the project
You'll need to clone the repository in order to have a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* Personally, I use Virtual Studio Code (VSC). Therefore, in order to run this code from the get-go, you'll need VSC and its python extension pack.<br>
If you do not use VSC, just remove `#%%` from the beginning and the end of the python file. </li>
* Atom is another IDE that supports cell by cell compilation with its extension hydrogen. However, I wouldn't recommend it because its High CPU and memory usage.

### Testing
Simply run the Python code with your favorite Python IDE with the right extensions and you are good to go! Just make sure to read the comments in the actual python file.
