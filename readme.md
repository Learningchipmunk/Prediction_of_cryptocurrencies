# Prediction of Cryptocurrencies 
The project aimed at predicting the behavior of a cryptocurrency with the given a dataset of values and time stamps. The approach that was chosen consists of finding stationarities in its behavior in order to predict 12 more values. That results in the prediction of the cryptocurrency's behavior for an hour after the last value of the given dataset.
